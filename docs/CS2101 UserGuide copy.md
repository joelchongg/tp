## Getting Started with FastCard

**Step 1: Install Java (if you haven't already)** <br>
FastCard requires **Java 17 or newer** to run. Java is free software that lets your computer run applications like FastCard.

**Check if you already have Java:**
1. Open your command terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux).
2. Type `java -version` and press Enter.
3. If you see "version 17" or higher, you're ready. Skip to Step 2.
4. If you see an error or a lower version number, install Java:
    * **Windows users:** Download Java 17 from [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html#java-17-installation-guide-for-windows-users).
    * **Linux users:** Download Java 17 from [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html#java-17-installation-guide-for-linux-users).
    * **Mac users:** Download Java 17 from [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html#java-17-installation-guide-for-mac-users).

**Step 2: Download FastCard**
1. Go to the FastCard releases page [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/releases).
2. Download the latest `fastcard.jar` file (look for the newest version at the top).
3. Save it somewhere easy to find (like your Desktop or Documents folder).

**Step 3: Set up your FastCard folder**
1. Create a new folder where you want to keep FastCard and all your contact data.
    * Example: Create a folder called "FastCard" in your Documents.
2. Move the `fastcard.jar` file into this folder.
3. Remember this location. This is where all your data will be saved.

**Step 4: Launch FastCard**
**Using the command terminal:**
1. Open your command terminal:
    * **Windows:** Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell"
    * **Mac:** Search for "Terminal" in Spotlight
    * **Linux:** Open your terminal application
2. Navigate to your FastCard folder by typing: `cd path/to/your/FastCard/folder` <br>
    * Example: `cd Documents/FastCard`
3. Run FastCard by typing: `java -jar fastcard.jar`
4. Press Enter

**What you should see:**
(First Use): FastCard's window should appear within a few seconds, showing a guiding message to get you get started.
![FastCard UI Initial](images/Ui.png)


The window shows:
- Contact list (showing sample contacts)
- Result display area (showing command feedback)
- Command box (where you type commands)

__Lets Start Fresh!__

(Subsequent - if empty): After starting fresh with [`clear`](#removing-all-contacts-clear), you'll be greeted with this message
![FastCard UI](images/Ui_init.png)

**Troubleshooting:**
  * If you see "java is not recognized" &rarr; Java isn't installed correctly. Return to Step 1
  * If you see "file not found" &rarr; You're not in the right folder. Check Step 4 Point 2.

**Step 5: Try your first commands**
Type a command in the command box and press **Enter** to execute it.

**Try these example commands:**
1. See all contacts: `list`
2. Add a new contact: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com c/Shopee`
3. Search for a contact: `find John`
4. Delete a contact: `delete John Doe`
5. Get help: `help`

**Step 6: Learn more commands**
Once you're comfortable with the basics, check out the [Features](#features) section below for the complete list of what FastCard can do.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

**WORDS IN CAPITALS = Replace with your information**
* Commands show placeholders in `UPPER_CASE` that you need to replace with actual information.<br>
  Example: In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` can be replaced with `John Doe`, resulting in `add n/John Doe`.

**[Square Brackets] = Optional**
* Anything in square brackets is optional. You can include it or skip it.<br>
  Example: `n/NAME [t/TAG]` means:
    * `n/John Doe t/client` (with optional tag)
    * `n/John Doe` (without tag, still works!)

**Three Dots‚Ä¶ = Repeat as needed**
* Items with `‚Ä¶` can be used multiple times or not at all.<br>
  Example: `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` means:
    * ` ` (no tags)
    * `t/client` (one tag)
    * `t/client t/highPriority t/hotLead` (multiple tags, add as many as you want!)

**Order Doesn't Matter**
* You can type the information in any order that makes sense to you.<br>
  Example: These commands do the exact same thing:
    * `addbasic n/John Doe p/91234567`
    * `addbasic p/91234567 n/John Doe`

**Extra Words Get Ignored**
* For simple commands like `help`, `list` and `exit`, anything extra you type will be ignored.<br>
  Example: Typing `help 123` or `help please` both just run `help`.

If you're reading this as a PDF and copying commands, be aware that spaces may get removed when you paste them into FastCard. This can cause commands to fail.

**Solution:** After pasting, check that spaces are still there, especially around line breaks.
</box>

### Getting help : `help`

Opens a help window with a link to the complete user guide.

**Format:** `help`

**What you need to know:**
  * Opens a popup window with help information
  * You can close the window to return to FastCard
  * You can also press `F1` as a keyboard shortcut

**When to use this:**
  * You forgot how a command works
  * You want to see all available commands
  * You need detailed examples or explanations
  * You're learning FastCard for the first time

**Example: Opening help window**
```
help
```
**You'll see:**
  * A popup window appears with the help message
  * The window displays "Refer to the user guide:..."
  * You can click `Browse` or `Copy URL` to access the complete user guide or to copy the URL respectively.

**In the main window:**
  * FastCard remains open in the background
  * You can continue using FastCard after closing the help window

&rarr; Quick access to full documentation when you need guidance

<box type="tip" seamless>

üí° Pro Tips:
  * **Use `F1` shortcut** - Press `F1` on your keyboard for instant help access without typing
  * **Keep guide bookmarked** - Save the user guide URL in your browser for quick reference
  * **Check before experimenting** - Review command formats in the guide before trying new commands

</box>

### Viewing all contacts : `list`

Shows your complete contact list, displaying everyone in FastCard.

**Format:** `list`

**What you need to know:**
  * Removes any active filters or searches

**When to use this:**
  * After you use `find` or `filter` to return to full view
  * You want to see all of contacts
  * To start fresh before a new search or filter

**Example: Viewing all contacts:**
```
list
```
**You'll see:**
```
Listed all persons
```
**In the contact list:**
  * All contacts reappear (any previous filters are removed)

&rarr; Use this as your "reset" command to see everyone after any operation

<box type="tip" seamless>

üí° Pro Tips:
  * **Your reset button** - Think of `list` as your "show everything" reset whenever you're narrowed down
  * **Before filtering** - Run `list` first to ensure you're starting with everyone visible
  * **After accidental filter** - If you filtered by mistake and can't find contacts, `list` brings everyone back

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * Expecting `list` to show filtered results &rarr; It shows **ALL** contacts (removes filters)
  * Thinking contacts are deleted when filtered &rarr; They're just hidden; `list` reveals them all

### Adding a contact quickly: `addbasic`

Quickly saves a contact with just their name and phone number - perfect when you meet someone and want to add details later.

**Format:** `addbasic n/NAME p/PHONE`

**What you need to provide:**
* **Name** (`n/`) - Full name (letters, numbers, spaces, `/`, `.`, and `-` allowed)
    * Note: The `/` character is supported to accommodate official namings such as `Rahul s/o Kumar`.  
      Similarly, you may use `.` or `-` in names if needed (e.g. `Rahul s.o. Kumar`, `Tan-Kumar`).
* **Phone** (`p/`) - At least 3 digits

**What you need to know:**
  * The combination of name **AND** phone number must be unique, you can't add two people with the same name and phone number combination
  * You can add more details later using the `edit` command

**When to use this:**
  * Quick entry during networking events or meetings
  * You only have basic contact information right now
  * Need to capture name and number fast, will add details later
  * Building a contact list from business cards

**Use `add` instead if:** You have complete information (email, company, tags) ready to enter.

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Quick add during a meeting**
```
addbasic n/Sarah Chen p/98765432
```
**You'll see:**
```
You have successfully added this contact:
Name: Sarah Chen
Phone: 98765432
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Sarah Chen appears with her phone number
  * Other fields (email, company, tags) are empty until you add them

&rarr; Adds Sarah Chen immediately. Later, use `edit Sarah Chen e/sarah@example.com c/Shopee` to complete her profile.

**Example 2: Adding a contact with allowed special sign in the name**
```
addbasic n/Rahul s/o Kumar p/91112222
```
**You'll see:**
  * Similar to above


<box type="tip" seamless>

üí° Pro Tip: Use `addbasic` during conversations or events to capture contacts immediately. Update with full details later using the `edit` command when you're back at your desk.

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * `addbasic n/Alice Tan` &rarr; Missing phone number (both name AND phone are required)
  * `addbasic Alice Tan 91234567` &rarr; Missing prefixes (need `n/` and `p/`)
  * Including reserved prefixes inside a name
    - **Symptom:** Commands like `add n/Alice p/o Bob p/91234567` fail or parse incorrectly (e.g., `p/` is treated as the start of the phone field, so the name becomes `Alice` and phone becomes `o Bob` ‚Üí error).
    - **Reason:** The parser treats any reserved prefix followed by `/` (e.g., `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `t/`) as a new field, even if it appears inside a value.
    - **Fix:** Do **not** include reserved prefixes with `/` inside names. If you must indicate relationships, use alternatives such as:
        - `Alice p.o. Bob`
        - `Alice p-o Bob`
    - **Note:** Common official patterns like `s/o` (son of) and `d/o` (daughter of) are **allowed** and safe, because `s/` and `d/` are not reserved prefixes.


### Adding a contact with complete details: `add`

Adds a contact with full information including name, phone, email, company, and optional tags.

**Format:** `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL c/COMPANY [t/TAG]‚Ä¶`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **Name** (`n/`) - Full name (letters, numbers, spaces, `/`, `.`, and `-` allowed)
    * Note: The `/` character is supported to accommodate official namings such as `Rahul s/o Kumar`.  
      Similarly, you may use `.` or `-` in names if needed (e.g. `Rahul s.o. Kumar`, `Tan-Kumar`).
  * **Phone** (`p/`) - At least 3 digits
  * **Email** (`e/`) - Valid email address (e.g., name@company.com)
    * * We *do not recommend* entering `unknown@example.com`, as it is used internally as an `invisible` placeholder when you do not specify an email for your contact.
    * * If you enter that specific value, you will not see the field in your FastCard interface.
  * **Company** (`c/`) - Company or organization name
    * * We *do not recommend* entering `N/A`, as it is used internally as an `invisible` placeholder when you do not specify an email for your contact.
    * * If you enter that specific value, you will not see the field in your FastCard interface.
  * **Tags** (`t/`) - Optional labels like "client", "colleague" or "vendor" (add as many as you want)

**What you need to know:**
  * The combination of name **AND** phone number must be unique (similar to `addbasic`)
  * Each email address must be unique across all contacts (except for placeholder emails like `unknown@example.com`)
  * All fields except tags are required
  * Add multiple tags by repeating `t/` (e.g., `t/client t/priority`)

**When to use this:**
  * You have all contact information ready to enter.
  * You want to organize contacts with tags immediately.
  * You're adding professional contacts that need full details.

**Use `addbasic` instead if:** You only have a name and phone number right now.

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Adding a client with multiple tags**
```
add n/Sarah Chen p/98765432 e/sarahchen@example.com c/Shopee t/client t/priority t/tech
```
**You'll see:**
```
New person added:
Name: Sarah Chen
Phone: 98765432
Email: sarahchen@example.com
Company: Shopee
Tags: [tech] [client] [priority]
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Sarah Chen appears with all details displayed
  * Tags are shown as colored labels next to the contact
  * Contact is added to the bottom of the current list

&rarr; Adds Sarah Chen with email, company, and three organizational tags for easy filtering

**Example 2: Adding a colleague without tags**
```
add n/Mike Kumar p/87654321 e/mike@company.com c/ABC Industries
```
**You'll see:**
  * Similar to above

&rarr; Adds Mike Kumar with all required details. Tags can be added later using `edit`

<box type="tip" seamless>

üí° Pro Tip:
  * **Create a tagging system** - Use consistent tags like `client`, `vendor`, `colleague`, `priority` across all contacts. This allows you to filter and find contacts quickly!

</box>

**Common Mistakes:**
  * `add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/john@example.com` &rarr; Forgetting to include all required fields (name, phone, email, company)
  * `add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/john@ c/Shopee` &rarr; Incomplete email address (missing domain)
  * `add John Doe 91234567 john@email.com Shopee` &rarr; Missing prefixes (need `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `c/`)
  * `add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/john@example.com c/Shopee t/friend, colleague` &rarr; Don't use commas between tags (repeat `t/` instead)
  * `add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/existing@email.com c/Shopee` &rarr; Trying to add a contact with an email that already exists (you'll see "This email already exists in the contact book")
  * Including reserved prefixes inside a name
      - **Symptom:** Commands like `add n/Alice p/o Bob p/91234567` fail or parse incorrectly (e.g., `p/` is treated as the start of the phone field, so the name becomes `Alice` and phone becomes `o Bob` ‚Üí error).
      - **Reason:** The parser treats any reserved prefix followed by `/` (e.g., `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `t/`) as a new field, even if it appears inside a value.
      - **Fix:** Do **not** include reserved prefixes with `/` inside names. If you must indicate relationships, use alternatives such as:
          - `Alice p.o. Bob`
          - `Alice p-o Bob`
      - **Note:** Common official patterns like `s/o` (son of) and `d/o` (daughter of) are **allowed** and safe, because `s/` and `d/` are not reserved prefixes.

### Updating contact information: `edit`

Updates an existing contact's information by either their name or position number in the list.

**Format:**
- `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [c/COMPANY] [t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã [t+/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã [t-/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã`
- `edit NAME  [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [c/COMPANY] [t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã [t+/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã [t-/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **Target contact** - Either the contact's `NAME` or their `INDEX` (position number in the displayed list)
  * **At least one field to update** - Any combination of name, phone, email, company, or tags
  * All fields are optional, but you must provide at least one

**What you need to know:**
  * **Edit by index** - Use the number shown next to the contact (must be 1, 2, 3, etc.)
  * **Edit by name** - Name matching is case-insensitive (`john doe` = `John Doe`)
  * **Full Name Required** - If editing by name, you need to provide the contact's full name (e.g., `edit Sarah` will not edit `Sarah Chen`'s contact)
  * **Multiple contacts with the same name** - FastCard will show all matches and ask you to edit by index instead
  * **Email uniqueness** - Each email address must be unique across all contacts (except for placeholder emails like `unknown@example.com`). You cannot change a contact's email to one that's already used by another contact
  * **Existing values are replaced** - For name, phone, email, and company fields, your new input completely replaces the old information
  * **Tags are flexible** - You can overwrite all tags (`t/`), add to existing tags (`t+/`), or remove specific tags (`t-/`)

**When to use this:**
  * You want to update outdated phone numbers or email addresses
  * You want to add company information to contacts added with `addbasic`
  * You need to correct typos in contact details
  * You want to add or change tags for better organization

<box type="warning" seamless>

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Tag Management - Three Ways to Update Tags**

FastCard offers three different ways to manage tags when editing:

**1. Overwrite All Tags (`t/`)**
  * Replaces ALL existing tags with new ones
  * Example: Contact has `[client][priority]`
  * Run: `edit John t/vendor`
  * Result: `[vendor]` (old tags are gone)
  * To remove all tags: `edit John t/`

**2. Add Tags (`t+/`)**
  * Adds new tags while keeping existing ones
  * Example: Contact has `[client]`
  * Run: `edit John t+/priority t+/vip`
  * Result: `[client][priority][vip]` (old tags kept, new tags added)
  * Note: Tag matching is case-insensitive. Adding `t+/CLIENT` to a contact with `[client]` won't change anything.

**3. Delete Tags (`t-/`)**
  * Removes specific tags while keeping others
  * Example: Contact has `[client][priority][vip]`
  * Run: `edit John t-/priority t-/vip`
  * Result: `[client]` (specified tags removed)
  * Note: You can only delete tags that exist. FastCard will warn you if a tag doesn't exist.
  * Note: Tag matching is case-insensitive. Using `t-/CLIENT` will remove the `[client]` tag.

**Can combine add and delete:**
  * Run: `edit John t+/vendor t-/client`
  * Removes `client` tag and adds `vendor` tag simultaneously

**‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot mix overwrite with add/delete:**
  * `t/` cannot be used together with `t+/` or `t-/` in the same command
  * Example: `edit John t/vendor t+/client` ‚Üí Error (conflicting tag operations)
  * Choose either: overwrite all tags OR add/delete specific tags

</box>

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Adding details to a basic contact (unique match)**
```
edit Alice Tan e/alice@example.com c/Shopee t/client
```
**You'll see:**
```
Edited Person:
Name: Alice Tan
Phone: 91234567
Email: alice@example.com
Company: Shopee
Tags: [client]
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Alice Tan's email, company and tags are updated
  * Other fields (name, phone) remain unchanged
 
&rarr; Adds email, company, and tags to Alice who was previously added with just name and phone

**Example 2: Edit by name (multiple matches)**
```
edit John Doe e/johndoe@company.com
```
**If multiple John Doe exist, you'll see:**
```
There are multiple contacts' names matched with the reference.
Please use the edit INDEX command to specify the contact you want to edit in the following list of matched contacts.
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Will only show contacts with the name `John Doe`

**Then run:** `edit 2 e/johndoe@company.com` to edit the specific John Doe

&rarr; Updates information of a specific John Doe contact

**Example 3: Adding tags without removing existing ones**
```
edit 1 t+/priority t+/vip
```
**You'll see:**
```
Edited Person:
Name: Sarah Chen
Phone: 98765432
Email: sarahchen@example.com
Company: Shopee
Tags: [client] [priority] [vip]
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Sarah Chen keeps her existing `[client]` tag
  * New `[priority]` and `[vip]` tags are added

&rarr; Adds new tags while preserving existing ones - perfect for gradually building up contact organization

**Example 4: Adding and removing tags simultaneously**
```
edit 2 t+/partner t-/client
```
**You'll see:**
  * The `[client]` tag is removed
  * The `[partner]` tag is added
  * All other tags remain unchanged

&rarr; Useful when contact's role changes (e.g., from client to partner)

<box type="tip" seamless>

üí° Pro Tips:
  * **Use `t+/` and `t-/` for gradual tag management** - Add or remove tags without worrying about losing existing ones
  * **View before editing** - Use `find` or `list` to see current tags before making changes
  * **Combine add and delete** - Change contact roles in one command: `edit John t+/vendor t-/client`

</box>

**Common Mistakes:**
  * `edit John Doe` &rarr; No fields provided (you must include at least one field to update)
  * `edit 0 p/91234567` &rarr; Invalid index (index starts at 1, not 0)
  * `edit 1 e/existing@email.com` &rarr; Trying to use an email that already belongs to another contact (you'll see "This email already exists in the contact book")
  * `edit 1 t/client t+/priority` &rarr; Cannot mix `t/` with `t+/` or `t-/` (conflicting tag operations)
  * `edit 1 t-/colleague` when contact doesn't have `[colleague]` tag &rarr; FastCard will show an error listing non-existent tags
  * `edit 1 t+/` or `edit 1 t-/` &rarr; Empty tag name (you must provide at least one tag after `t+/` or `t-/`)

### Searching for contacts by name: `find`
Quickly finds contacts whose names or companies match the keywords you provide.
You can search by name, company, or both at the same time.

**Format:** 
`find [n/NAME`] [`find c/COMPANY`]

**What you need to provide:**
  * `n/` ‚Äì keyword that appears in the contact‚Äôs name
  * `c/` ‚Äì keyword that appears in the contact‚Äôs company
  * At least to provide one prefix with its value. Can do search via both

**What you need to know:**
* Searches are **case-insensitive** ‚Äì `google`, `Google`, and `GOOGLE` all match the same results
* Supports **partial (substring)** matches ‚Äì typing `Han` will find `Hans` or `Hannah`
* Both name and company searches can be combined (logical **AND**)

    * `find n/Alice c/NUS` ‚Üí finds contacts whose **name contains ‚ÄúAlice‚Äù** **and** whose **company contains ‚ÄúNUS‚Äù**
* If only one prefix is provided, only that field is searched
* The number of matching contacts will be displayed after searching

**When to use this:**
  * You remember only part of someone‚Äôs name or their company name
  * You want to find all contacts working in the same organisation
  * You want to narrow your search by both name and company

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Finding a specific person**
```
find n/Sarah
```
**You'll see (depending on the number of contacts containing Sarah in their full name):**
```
2 persons listed!
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Only contacts with "Sarah" in their name are displayed.
  
&rarr; Shows all contacts with "Sarah" in their name (Sarah Chen, Sarah Kumar, etc.)

**Example 2: Finding contact(s) with specified company**
```
find c/Google
```
**You'll see:**
  * Similar to above

&rarr; Shows everyone with "Google" OR "Google SG" etc.

**Example 3: Finding contact(s) with specified name and company**
```
find n/Jadon c/Google
```
**You'll see:**
* Similar to above

&rarr; Shows everyone with name containing "Jadon" and company containing "Google"

<box type="tip" seamless>

üí° Pro Tips:
  * **Return to full list** - Use `list` after searching to see all contacts again
  * **Narrow your search** - Use fewer, more specific keywords for better results
  * **Search by tags instead** - If you're looking by tags, use `filter` instead

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * `find Han` expecting to find "Hans" &rarr; Partial words don't match (must be complete: `find Hans`)

### Filtering Contacts: `filter`

Shows only contacts that have specific tags - perfect for viewing contacts by category like "client", "vendor", or "priority".

**Format:** `filter t/TAG [t/TAG]‚Ä¶`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **At least one tag** - The tag name you want to filter by (e.g., `client` or `vendor`)
  * **Multiple tags (optional)** - Add more tags to broaden your search

**What you need to know:**
  * You must specify at least one tag
  * You can specify more than one tag
    * Contacts with **any** of those tags will appear (not all tags required)
    * Specifying the same tag multiple times will be treated as it being specified once
  * Tags are not case-sensitive (`t/client` = `t/CLIENT`)
  * You should only specify tags (specifying other parameters is invalid e.g., `filter t/colleague n/John`)
  * You may list the tags in any order.
  * The exact tag name must match (e.g., `client` won't find contacts tagged with `clients`)
  * Tags specified must be alphanumeric and at most 30 characters
  * Leading and trailing whitespaces are trimmed
  * If no contacts contain any of the specified tags, an empty contact list will be shown
  * The global contact list shown by `list` command will be filtered, and not the currently displayed contact list
  * If no contacts match the specified tags, an empty contact list is shown

**When to use this:**
  * You want to view all contacts in a specific category (all clients, all vendors, etc.)
  * You want to prepare for meetings by filtering relevant contacts
  * You need to quickly access frequently-contacted groups

**Examples:**

**Example 1: View all clients**
```
filter t/client
```
**You'll see (depending on the number of contacts with the client tag):**
```
3 persons listed!
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Only contacts tagged with "client" are displayed

&rarr; Shows only contacts tagged as "client" - perfect before a client review meeting

**Example 2: View multiple business categories**
```
filter t/client t/vendor t/partner
```
**You'll see:**
  * Similar to above

&rarr; Shows anyone tagged as client, vendor, OR partner - useful for business contact overview

<box type="tip" seamless>

üí° Pro Tips:
  * **Return to full list** - Use `list` after searching to see all contacts again
  * **Search by name instead** - If you're looking by name, use `find` instead

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * `filter client` &rarr; Missing `t/` prefix (need `filter t/client`)
  * `filter t/` &rarr; Empty tag (must provide at least one tag name)

### Organizing contacts alphabetically: `sort`

Arranges your contacts in alphabetical order based on the field you choose - useful for organizing your list.

**Format:** `sort f/FIELD o/ORDER`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **Field** (`f/`) - What to sort by: `name` or `tag`
  * **Order** (`o/`) - Direction: `asc` (ascending/A-Z) or `desc` (descending/Z-A)

**Available fields:**
  * `name` - Sort by contact name
  * `tag` - Sort by the first tag alphabetically (e.g., If a contact has tags `vendor` and `priority`, the `priority` tag will be used for sorting by tag as it is the first tag in alphabetical order)

**Available orders:**
  * `asc` or `ascending` - 0 to 9 followed by A to Z order
  * `desc` or `descending` - Z to A followed by 9 to 0 order

**What you need to know:**
  * You should specify both field and order only (Specifying other parameters is invalid)
  * You should only specify one field and one order
  * Field and order are not case-sensitive. (`NAME = name`, `ASC` = `asc`)
  * Contacts without the sorted field appear at the start (for ascending order) or end (for descending order)
  * Leading and trailing whitespaces are trimmed
  * Sorting permanently reorders your contacts (Reloading FastCard will preserve the ordering of the contacts you sorted)
  * If multiple contacts contain the same field to be sorted by (ignoring case-sensitivity), the relative ordering of these contacts will be the same as the relative ordering before sorting.

<box type="warning" seamless>

The `sort` command works on the overall contact list and not just a filtered list from `find` or `filter`.

</box>

**When to use this:**
  * You want to organize your contact list for easier scanning
  * You need to prepare alphabetically ordered lists for meetings or reports
  * You want to group contacts by tag categories

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Alphabetize all contacts**
```
sort f/name o/asc
```
**You'll see:**
```
Sorted all persons by name in ascending order
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Contacts are now alphabetically ordered A&rarr;Z by name

&rarr; Orders everyone A&rarr;Z by name - perfect for quickly locating someone in a long list

**Example 2: Reverse alphabetical order**
```
sort f/name o/desc
```
**You'll see:**
  * Similar to above

&rarr; Orders everyone Z&rarr;A by name

<box type="tip" seamless>

üí° Pro Tip:
  * **Check tag organization** - Use `sort f/tag o/asc` to see how well your tagging system groups contacts

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * `sort f/name` &rarr; Missing order (must provide both field **AND** order)
  * `sort o/asc` &rarr; Missing field (same as above)
  * `sort f/phone o/asc` &rarr; Invalid field (only `name` and `tag` are supported)

### Removing a contact : `delete`

Permanently removes a contact from FastCard - use with caution as this cannot be undone.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Permanent Deletion**

Deleted contacts are **permanently removed** and cannot be recovered. Double-check you're deleting the correct person before pressing Enter.

**Best practice:** Use `find` first to verify contact details before deleting.

</box>

**Format:** 
- `delete NAME`
- `delete INDEX`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **Either** - The contact's `NAME`
  * **Or** - The contact's `INDEX` (position number in the displayed list)

**What you need to know:**
  * **Delete by name or index** - Deleting by name or index works similarly to the `edit` command
  * **Deletion is permanent** - There is no undo function
  * **Delete by name** - Name matching is case-insensitive (`john doe` = `John Doe`)

**When to use this:** 
  * You want to remove outdated contacts
  * You want to delete test contacts after trying out FastCard
  * You want to clear out incorrect entries

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Delete by name (unique match)**
```
delete Alice Tan
```
**You'll see:**
```
Deleted Person: 
Name: Alice Tan
Phone: 91234567
Email: alice@example.com
Company: Shopee
Tags: [colleague]
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Alice Tan is immediately removed and no longer appears.

**Example 2: Delete by name (multiple matches)**
```
delete John Doe
```
**If multiple John Doe exist, you'll see (depending on the number of John Doe contacts):**
```
Multiple persons named John Doe found. Please specify the index to delete.
2 persons listed!
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Will only show contacts with the name `John Doe`

**Then run:** `delete 2` to delete the specific John Doe

&rarr; Deletes a specific John Doe contact

<box type="tip" seamless>

üí° Pro Tips:
  * **Always verify first** - Use `find` to check contact details before deleting
  * **Note the index carefully** - After each deletion, indexes shift down (what was 3. becomes 2.)
  * **Consider editing instead** - If information is outdated, use `edit` to update rather than deleting and re-adding

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * `delete 0` &rarr; Invalid index (index starts at 1, not 0)
  * `delete 5` when only 3 contacts shown &rarr; Index out of range (must be within displayed list)

### View Details: `view`

Toggles the Detail Pane showing specified user in detail.

![FastCard UI](images/Ui_detail.png)

**Format:**
  * `view INDEX`

**Examples:**
**Example 1: View Details of contact in index 1**
```
view 1
```
**You'll see:**
  * The full information about the user (if it's too long to be shown on the main card)
  * (If Focus Person has not been selected yet) -> Shows a guiding message.
  * Detail Pane toggle to view (if not already visible)

**When should you use this?**
  * When you want to view the full version of the contact info 
  * When you want a quick reference to the information to transfer to another application
  * Buttons corresponding to each core information is displayed 
  * Clicking on the button will add the information to your clipboard for ease of transfer

<box type="tip" seamless>

üí° Pro Tips:
  * When you edit the currently focused Contact, the information may become stale! 
  * Simply ensure that you refresh calling `view INDEX` again!

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>
<b>Why isn't this a command instead?</b>

  - While our application aims to be mainly command focused for familiar users
  - We acknowledge the efficiency and accuracy of a single click action in this case
  - Especially since the expected use case is for extended interactions off app (which likely takes clicks!)

</box>

### Recalling previous commands - Command History

FastCard allows you to quickly repeat commands that you entered previously - saves time when repeating similar commands.

**How to use:**
  * Press &uarr; (Up Arrow) - Go back in  command history (most recent first)
  * Press &darr; (Down Arrow) - Go forward in command history

**What you need to know:**
  * Command history saves all valid executed commands from your current session
  * History persists only for the current session (resets when you restart FastCard)
  * When you reach the end of history, you'll see "End of Command History reached"

**When to use this:**
  * You are repeating similar commands with slight modifications (e.g., adding multiple contacts)
  * You want to save time and avoid retyping long commands with many fields
  * You want to check what commands you ran recently

**Example: Recalling your last command**
You previously typed:
```
filter t/vendor
```
Now press &uarr;
**You'll see (in the command box):**
```
filter t/vendor
```
The command appears in your command box, ready to be edited or executed again.

<box type="tip" seamless>

üí° Pro Tip:
  * **Skip retyping** - For complex commands with many fields, recall and modify instead of typing from scratch to save time

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * Pressing &uarr; then immediately pressing Enter &rarr; Accidentally re-executes the previous command (review it first!)
  * Expecting history after restart &rarr; History clears when you close FastCard (only lasts current session)

### Export the Contact List : `export`
Exports all contacts in the address book into a **CSV** file on your **Desktop**.
This allows users to back up or view their contact list in spreadsheet applications such as Excel or Numbers.

**Format:**
* `export f/FILENAME`

**Example: Export the Contact List as a csv file with customised name**
```
export f/ContactList
```
**You'll see:**
* A file named as "ContactList.csv" is now in your Desktop
* There are some cases that the empty fields will put in the placeholders:
  * No email: exported CSV will show the email field as `unknown@email.com`
  * No company: exported CSV will show the company field as `N/A`
  * No tag(s): exported CSV will leave the tag field empty

**Details:**

* If a file with the same name already exists on your Desktop,
  it will be **overwritten without confirmation**.
* File names are **case-sensitive** ‚Äî
  `export f/Contacts` and `export f/contacts` will create two different files.
* Allowed characters for filenames follow this regular expression:

  ```
  ^[a-zA-Z0-9._()\-\s]+$
  ```

  This means filenames can contain **letters, numbers, spaces, underscores `_`, dashes `-`, dots `.`, and parentheses `()`**.
  Slashes/Backslashes and dots are **not allowed**.
* Multiple spaces will automatically be **normalized into a single space**.
  Example:
  `export f/  my   new   list` ‚Üí `my new list.csv`
* If you export a contact file with the same name, it will overwrite the existing file on your Desktop**.

üí° **Pro Tip:**
* Need to share your contact list with others? Just **export it!**
* Use the `export` command to instantly create a sharable CSV file on your Desktop.
* Send the exported file via email or upload it to your team drive ‚Äî everyone can open it easily in Excel or Numbers to view your contact list.



### Removing all contacts : `clear`

Permanently deletes every contact from FastCard - use only when starting completely fresh.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This permanently deletes ALL contacts from FastCard. This cannot be undone.**

Before using `clear`:
  * **Backup your data** - Copy the `addressbook.json` file from your FastCard data folder
  * **Triple-check** - Make absolutely sure you want to erase everything

**Use this command ONLY when:** You're certain you want to start with a completely empty contact list.

</box>

**Format:** `clear`

**When NOT to use this:**
  * Removing specific outdated contacts - Use `delete` instead
  * Cleaning up a few contacts - Use `filter` or `find` then delete individually

**Example: Starting fresh after testing. (With a filled contact list)**
```
clear
```
**You'll see:**
```
This will delete all your contacts (action irreversible!)
If you'd like to continue, confirm with input [clear <CONFIRM_WORD>]
```
The <CONFIRM_WORD> will be shown to you in the feedback screen. 
If you accept that the list will be irreversibly cleared, simply input as guided.
```
clear <CONFIRM_WORD>
```
Finally you'll see the empty list with the response:
```
Contact book has been cleared!
```

**In the contact list:**
  * All contacts disappear immediately
  * You're left with a completely empty contact list

&rarr; Removes all sample contacts you added while learning FastCard

**Common mistakes:**
  * Assuming there's a confirmation &rarr; There isn't - it deletes immediately
  * Thinking you can undo &rarr; You can't - deletion is permanent

### Closing FastCard : `exit`

Closes the FastCard application.

**Format:** `exit`

**What you need to provide:**
  * Nothing - just type `exit` and press Enter

**What you need to know:**
  * All data is automatically saved before closing (no manual save needed)
  * Window closes immediately after command executes

**When to use this:**
  * You're finished managing contacts for now
  * You need to restart FastCard for any reason

**Example: Exiting after usage**
```
exit
```
**You'll see:**
  * FastCard window closes immediately
  * No confirmation message (just exits)

**Alternative ways to close:**
  * Click the `X` button in the window corner
  * Use `Alt+F4` (Windows) or `Cmd+Q` (Mac) keyboard shortcuts

### Saving Data

<box type="info" seamless>

**Your data is automatically saved**
FastCard saves your contacts automatically every time you make a change.

**What this means for you:**
  * Add, edit, or delete a contact &rarr; automatically saved.
  * Close FastCard anytime &rarr; your data is safe.
  * No risk of losing work if you forget to save.

**Where your data is stored:** All contacts are saved to your computer's hard drive where the FastCard application is located.

</box>

### Editing the data file

<box type="info" seamless>

Your contact data is stored in a file called `addressbook.json` located in `[JAR file location]/data/`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Manual editing is risky**

**If you edit this file incorrectly:**
  * FastCard will delete **ALL** your data and start with an empty file
  * The app may behave unpredictably
  * You could lose all your contacts permanently

**Before editing:**
  * Make a backup copy of the file
  * Only proceed if you understand JSON file format
  * Test with a small change first

**Recommendation:** Use FastCard's commands instead of editing the file directly. It's much safer.

</box>

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my client contacts to another Computer?** <br>
**A**:
  1. On your old computer, locate the `addressbook.json` file in `[JAR file location]/data/`.
  2. Copy this file to the other computer.
  3. Install FastCard on your other computer.
  4. Replace the new `addressbook.json` file with your copied file.
  5. Restart FastCard. All your contacts should appear.

**Q: Can I undo a command I just entered?** <br>
**A**: No, FastCard doesn't have an undo feature. Commands take effect immediately and are saved automatically. Be especially careful with `delete` and `clear` commands.

**Q: What happens if FastCard crashes? Will I lose all my client contacts?** <br>
**A:** Your data is safe. Since FastCard saves automatically after every change, you'll only lose any command you were typing when it crashed (not the data itself).

**Q: I accidentally deleted a client contact. Can I recover it?** <br>
**A:** Unfortunately, no. FastCard doesn't have a recycle bin or recovery feature. The contact is permanently deleted. Consider backing up your `addressbook.json` file regularly.

**Q: Why isn't my command working?** <br>
**A:** Common reasons include:
  * Spelling mistakes (check the exact command format)
  * Missing required information (like phone number for `add`)
  * Typos in the command
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

<u>**FastCard opens off-screen when using multiple screens**</u>

**Problem:** If you used FastCard on a secondary monitor, then disconnected it, FastCard may open in an invisible location.

**Solution:**
  1. Close FastCard completely.
  2. Find and delete the `preferences.json` file in your FastCard folder.
  3. Restart FastCard. It should open on your main screen.

<u>**Help window stays minimized**</u>

**Problem:** If you minimize the Help window and press `F1` (or type `help`) again, nothing appears to happen.

**What's actually happening:** The Help window is already open but minimized.

**Solution:** Look for the minimized Help window in your taskbar and click it to restore it.

<u>**Slight Flicker when clicking cards**</u>

**Problem:** Clicking the contact card in list view may cause slight flickering

**Solution:** Since there's no functionality tied to clicking of the items in the list. Simply refrain from doing so.

**Ability to pull out detail pane without content**

**Solution** Please use the `view` command to toggle the pane instead before adjusting its width.
